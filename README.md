This API will give you the data about some drinks in json format.  
Each object of the drinks will have `id` & `name` & `description` made in this format:  
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Some juice",
    "description": "Very yummy juice üòã"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Another juice",
    "description": "Also great juice made from ...."
  }
]
```

_This API is runing mainly on `domain.com/drinks/`_
